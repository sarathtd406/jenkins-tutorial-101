## Jenkins tutorial for beginners

#### Let's get started !!

### 1. Download Jenkins docker image

First, let us download the offical jenkins docker image from docker hub website [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=jenkins)

As the Jenkins official Docker image is deprecated, we need to use the next docker image from the search list. This jenkins/jenkins image is maintained by Jenkins community and continuously updated.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sarathtd406/jenkins-tutorial-101/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
